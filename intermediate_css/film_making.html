        <h1>Learn a bit about film making</h1>
        <p>Don’t be precious about your footage, however proud
            of it you are. The finished film is the important
            thing. You may need to leave out some really good
            stuff if it doesn’t fit. (But don’t delete any clips
            unless you’re absolutely sure they’re unusable.)
        </p>
        <p>Choose the clips that show the essential action.
            You can leave out anything that doesn’t help tell
            the story. Use just the part of the clip that has
            the action you need.
